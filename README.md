# Shark App Project

## Project Objective
The goal of the Shark App Project is to predict the level of risk of a shark attack for various marine activities. This project aims to develop an app that provides users with insights on the likelihood of a shark incident, assisting them in making informed decisions about water-based activities.

## Dataset
- **Shark Incident Database**: The primary data source is a shark incident database containing records of shark encounters and incidents. This data includes information such as date, location, activity type, and shark species involved, which will be used to identify patterns and risk factors.

## Project Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Each team member will perform an initial analysis to explore and understand the data. The EDA process will help uncover trends, correlations, and possible data quality issues, providing a foundation for the modeling phase.

2. **Modeling**: 
   - Build a predictive model to assess the risk level associated with specific water activities, locations, and other relevant factors. The model will serve as the basis for risk prediction in the Shark App.

## Actions
- **Individual EDA**: Each team member will conduct an individual EDA to brainstorm potential approaches for the model, gain insights on data structure, and contribute ideas to the project's direction.
- **Collaborative Learning**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and brainstorm feature engineering ideas for improving model accuracy.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
├── data/                # Dataset and related files
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model experimentation
├── src/                 # Source code for model development and app implementation
├── app/                 # App-related files and configuration
├── README.md            # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shark-app-project.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run EDA notebooks or start developing models in the `notebooks` directory.

## Future Work
- Finalize model selection and evaluation
- Integrate model with a user-friendly app interface
- Continuous improvement of the model with updated data
